#   OOP PHP Contact Book
##  A contact book that allows users to manage their contacts, including adding, updating, and deleting contacts.  Additionally, users can create contact groups and add contacts to these groups

Every part of this project is a sample code which shows how to do the following:

*   Add, Update, and Delete Contacts: Users should be able to add new contacts, update 
    existing contact information, and delete contacts from the contact book.
*   Add Contacts to Groups: Users should be able to add contacts to the contact groups they have created
*   Contact Information: Contact information should include the following attributes: name, gender, email, phone number, and address. 
    All attributes except the name are optional.
*   Avatar Representation: Each contact should have an avatar with a background color
    represented by the first letter of their name, like Gmail's implementation. 
*   Alphabetical Arrangement: Contacts should be arranged alphabetically by their names
*   Searchable Contacts: Users should be able to search for contacts based on their 
    attributes (name, email, or phone number).
*   Filter Contacts: Users should be able to filter contacts alphabetically or by the date they 
    were created
